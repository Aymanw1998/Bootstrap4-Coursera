00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.880
Let me do a quick introduction to Bootstrap before we go on to

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.240
learn how to make use of Bootstrap in designing our website.

3
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.275
If you go to the Bootstrap webpage,

4
00:00:17.275 --> 00:00:23.230
you will see that Bootstrap claims to be the most popular HTML, CSS,

5
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.480
and JavaScript based framework that is in use today and specially designed

6
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.155
for developing responsive mobile first websites.

7
00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:42.325
Indeed, Bootstrap stands up to its claim as the most popular framework.

8
00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:51.005
It supports a number of CSS classes that enable you to design radius,

9
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:54.385
web components very effectively.

10
00:00:54.385 --> 00:01:01.280
It supports consistent typography to be used on your webpage for rendering content.

11
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.010
It supports many different kinds of that components like buttons,

12
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.805
tables, navigation bars, modals,

13
00:01:08.805 --> 00:01:13.655
images, carousels, and many other,

14
00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:17.940
as well as many JavaScript enabled competence.

15
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.720
This enables you to design responsive websites with the mobile first approach.

16
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.375
We will talk more about this in the next lesson.

17
00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:32.949
Bootstrap originated around 2011.

18
00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:36.925
It was created by these two people from Twitter.

19
00:01:36.925 --> 00:01:42.205
Hence, you might often hear people talking about Bootstrap as Twitter Bootstrap.

20
00:01:42.205 --> 00:01:46.060
Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton from Twitter designed

21
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.060
Bootstrap for their own internal use and then ended up releasing

22
00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:00.250
it for the rest of the web development community to use for consistent website design.

23
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.350
The current production version of Bootstrap is 4.0.

24
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.015
If you had taken my earlier specialization on Coursera,

25
00:02:11.015 --> 00:02:18.545
I have dealt with Bootstrap 3.3.7 in the earlier Bootstrap course.

26
00:02:18.545 --> 00:02:21.160
Now, it's time to move on to

27
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.310
our first exercise where we will get our hands dirty with Bootstrap.
