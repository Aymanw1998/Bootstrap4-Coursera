00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.210
Strap on your boots,

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.470
and let's get started with Bootstrap.

3
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.045
I'm sure your fingers are itching to get your hands around Bootstrap.

4
00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:18.250
So, first step, go to

5
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.280
the exercise instructions that follow this video

6
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.805
in your Bootstrap course page on Coursera.

7
00:00:27.805 --> 00:00:29.840
And then in the instructions,

8
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.520
you will see a link to this file Bootstrap4-starter.zip.

9
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.695
Download the zip file to your computer.

10
00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:46.610
Also, the step-by-step instructions that are illustrated in this video will

11
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.995
also be given in the exercise instructions that follow this video.

12
00:00:52.995 --> 00:01:00.595
There, you will have access to any of the code snippets that you need for this exercise.

13
00:01:00.595 --> 00:01:04.920
This would be the case for all the exercises in the future, too.

14
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.125
So, should you need to get hold of the code snippets,

15
00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:10.145
that is where you will find them.

16
00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:12.180
Once you download the zip file,

17
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.230
move that zip file to a convenient location on your computer.

18
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.375
So, here, I have moved it to a folder named Coursera on my computer,

19
00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:27.145
and then I have the zip file with this long name there.

20
00:01:27.145 --> 00:01:28.765
Just unzip the file.

21
00:01:28.765 --> 00:01:30.445
Once you unzip the file,

22
00:01:30.445 --> 00:01:36.715
you will find a folder named Bootstrap4 created in your computer.

23
00:01:36.715 --> 00:01:38.965
Inside the Bootstrap4 folder,

24
00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:42.450
you will see another folder named conFusion, there.

25
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.260
Go into the conFusion folder and you would see two files there,

26
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.600
index.html and package.json file.

27
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.795
Now, open a command window or

28
00:01:53.795 --> 00:02:00.290
a terminal and then move to this folder in your command window or terminal.

29
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.125
At the command prompt, type npm install.

30
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:09.150
Note that I already have the package.json file in there.

31
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.745
So the package.json file is configured so that

32
00:02:12.745 --> 00:02:19.200
the lite-server development dependency would be installed if I type npm install.

33
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.150
So, once you type npm install,

34
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.160
you will see that the lite-server will be installed in your node_modules folder each.

35
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.415
Once this is complete,

36
00:02:30.415 --> 00:02:35.930
open this folder in your favorite editor.

37
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.060
Once you have the folder open in your editor,

38
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.170
create a.gitignore file and

39
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.530
then put node_modules into the gitignore file and save.

40
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.940
So this is to ensure that when you do a gitcommit,

41
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.615
the node_modules folder will not be committed.

42
00:02:57.615 --> 00:03:05.475
After that, it is time to go and fetch Bootstrap for use in our project.

43
00:03:05.475 --> 00:03:08.050
Before we fetch Bootstrap,

44
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.810
let's do a commit of the current state of the file.

45
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.535
So, do git init and initialize your git repository.

46
00:03:18.535 --> 00:03:21.600
Then you can check git status,

47
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.290
and you would see that these files need to be committed,

48
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.315
add all the files,

49
00:03:29.315 --> 00:03:38.885
gitcommit -m "Initial Setup".

50
00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:43.745
So this is the starting point of your folder at this moment.

51
00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:52.785
So, with this, your starting point of your web project has been now committed to git.

52
00:03:52.785 --> 00:03:57.770
Now you can set up this git to synchronize with an online repository,

53
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.800
just like we talked about in the git exercises.

54
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.690
So you can set up a repository either on Bitbucket or on Github and then

55
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.430
synchronize this project to that git repository.

56
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.265
Our next step is to go and fetch Bootstrap.

57
00:04:15.265 --> 00:04:25.260
To do that, add the prompt type npm install bootstrap@4.0.0 and also --save,

58
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.470
and let the Bootstrap be installed.

59
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.880
Once Bootstrap is installed,

60
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.535
we realize that we also need to install its peer,

61
00:04:35.535 --> 00:04:38.975
which is jQuery as well as Popper.js.

62
00:04:38.975 --> 00:04:46.350
So let's go ahead and install both jQuery and Popper.js into this project folder.

63
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.905
So, to do that, add the prompt type npm install

64
00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:55.115
jquery@3.3.1

65
00:04:55.115 --> 00:05:03.185
and Popper.js@1.12.9 --save.

66
00:05:03.185 --> 00:05:06.385
Now, whenever I install any of the npm packages,

67
00:05:06.385 --> 00:05:11.620
I am explicitly specifying the version of the package that you should install.

68
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.580
The reason for this is that I want to make sure that as you go through this exercise,

69
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.500
all the steps will work correctly.

70
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.380
So I am specifying the exact version of the npm modules to be installed.

71
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:33.235
So, here, we are installing the jQuery version 3.3.1 and Popper.js version 1.12.9.

72
00:05:33.235 --> 00:05:40.895
Subsequently, also, I will specify the exact versions of the modules to be installed.

73
00:05:40.895 --> 00:05:44.130
So let's go ahead and install these.

74
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.030
And once they are installed,

75
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.055
we can go to the next step.

76
00:05:51.055 --> 00:05:55.615
Going back to our project folder,

77
00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:58.070
you would see that if you go into node_modules,

78
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.675
you will see a folder in there named Bootstrap.

79
00:06:02.675 --> 00:06:04.865
And inside the folder named Bootstrap,

80
00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:07.845
you'll find a folder named dist.

81
00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:09.910
So, inside dist folder,

82
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.705
you'll find two sub-folders named CSS and js.

83
00:06:13.705 --> 00:06:15.775
If you go into the CSS folder,

84
00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:20.820
you'll find a whole bunch of precompiled CSS files here.

85
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:27.630
The one that is of interest to us at the start is Bootstrap min.css.

86
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.620
That's the file that we are going to include into our

87
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.020
index.html file in order to make use of Bootstrap in our project.

88
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.820
Similarly, going to the js folder,

89
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.165
you would see that there is a Bootstrap min.js file.

90
00:06:42.165 --> 00:06:45.680
We're going to include that also into our index.htm.

91
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.790
So that'll be the next step that you will see me doing.

92
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.215
Before we go to the next step,

93
00:06:51.215 --> 00:06:55.550
let's start up our lite-server so that we can see the changes that we make to the

94
00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.860
index.html immediately reflected into our web page in real time.

95
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.630
So let's start up lite-servers.

96
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.240
So, type the prompt type npm start,

97
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.915
and then that should start up your lite-server.

98
00:07:09.915 --> 00:07:13.485
You can now see, on the screen,

99
00:07:13.485 --> 00:07:21.785
my editor on the left and the current version of the index.html page on the right.

100
00:07:21.785 --> 00:07:23.215
So, as you can see,

101
00:07:23.215 --> 00:07:27.615
I have already configured the index.html page with some content.

102
00:07:27.615 --> 00:07:33.820
This web page looks like the typical web page of a computer science professor.

103
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:41.170
Let's now open the index.html page in our editor.

104
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.645
And then in the head part of the index.html page,

105
00:07:45.645 --> 00:07:47.360
right before the title,

106
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.935
I'm going to paste in a little bit of code.

107
00:07:49.935 --> 00:07:53.730
This code snippet is given to you in the instructions.

108
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.740
So you can simply copy and paste this code snippet,

109
00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.765
and I'll walk you through what this code snippet is trying to do.

110
00:08:00.765 --> 00:08:05.585
You will notice that I have three meta tags here.

111
00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:09.130
The first one says charset="utf-8".

112
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.860
So this is the unicode that is going to be used.

113
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:17.675
The second line which says meta name="viewport",

114
00:08:17.675 --> 00:08:21.100
I'm going to come back and explain this particular line to

115
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.745
you in the next lesson when we will look at responsive web design.

116
00:08:25.745 --> 00:08:30.100
Now, let me draw your attention to this particular line which

117
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.840
says link rel="stylesheet", and then href.

118
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:43.495
Note that I am specifying href as "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css".

119
00:08:43.495 --> 00:08:49.150
So what I am specifying is that the bootstrap.min.css file,

120
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.970
which contains the CSS classes corresponding to Bootstrap that we have

121
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.995
downloaded using NPM to our node_modules folder,

122
00:08:57.995 --> 00:09:05.350
I'm going to include that into the head of my index.html page.

123
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:09.370
So you need to include the CSS classes provided by Bootstrap.

124
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:15.150
You also need to include the JavaScript classes provided by Bootstrap,

125
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.445
which we're going to do at the bottom of this page.

126
00:09:19.445 --> 00:09:23.465
Going to the bottom of this page, note,

127
00:09:23.465 --> 00:09:27.400
just before the closing body tag,

128
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:32.820
I'm going to paste in the code to include all the scripts there.

129
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.105
So, to do that,

130
00:09:35.105 --> 00:09:41.300
I just paste in the three lines for the script to include the jQuery,

131
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.085
Popper.js, and also the Bootstrap min.js.

132
00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:48.635
And note the order in which I have included this.

133
00:09:48.635 --> 00:09:50.895
So the Bootstrap is at the bottom.

134
00:09:50.895 --> 00:09:57.340
Then, since Bootstrap is dependent upon both jQuery and Popper in that order,

135
00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.945
so I will first input jQuery.

136
00:09:59.945 --> 00:10:03.835
And then after that, we input Popper, and then finally,

137
00:10:03.835 --> 00:10:09.585
Bootstrap min.js at the bottom of the index.html file.

138
00:10:09.585 --> 00:10:13.400
Now, this is included at the bottom of the page.

139
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.665
Because when you are loading the page from a web server,

140
00:10:18.665 --> 00:10:24.360
you want the CSS classes to be loaded immediately so that as the page starts rendering,

141
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.430
when the JavaScript is fetched,

142
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.810
the JavaScript needs to execute in order to make changes

143
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.395
to your page with the JavaScript code,

144
00:10:33.395 --> 00:10:34.970
and that will take a little bit of time.

145
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.060
So you don't want the user to be waiting for

146
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:43.805
the entire page to be loaded before they see something in their browser window.

147
00:10:43.805 --> 00:10:48.720
So that's why we normally load the JavaScript classes

148
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:55.325
towards the end of our html page just before the body tech.

149
00:10:55.325 --> 00:10:58.270
After making these changes,

150
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.065
let's save the file.

151
00:11:00.065 --> 00:11:04.420
Now, the reason why I am showing the index.html

152
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:09.385
file in my editor and also the browser right next to it is,

153
00:11:09.385 --> 00:11:13.630
the moment you save the changes that you have made to the index.html file,

154
00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:18.920
note how the browser rendering of that file

155
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:26.525
immediately updates and see Bootstrap already in action on the page.

156
00:11:26.525 --> 00:11:33.150
Right now, you'll see that your page is using Times New Roman to render all the content.

157
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.130
The moment I save the web page,

158
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:42.670
you notice that the fonts being used on your web page have changed.

159
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:48.425
Now, your web page is set up to make use of the Bootstrap classes,

160
00:11:48.425 --> 00:11:53.850
and it is using Bootstraps default typography to render all the content.

161
00:11:53.850 --> 00:12:01.360
Bootstrap by default uses Helvetica Neue for the font.

162
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.180
You can change the default font for bootstrap and so on,

163
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.905
but that will be beyond the scope of our discussion right now.

164
00:12:09.905 --> 00:12:15.120
So, once you set up your index.html page and save it,

165
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.710
you will immediately see Bootstrap coming into action in our web page.

166
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.675
So this is how I'm going to keep illustrating,

167
00:12:23.675 --> 00:12:27.385
as we add various bootstraps, CSS classes,

168
00:12:27.385 --> 00:12:30.435
and components to our web page,

169
00:12:30.435 --> 00:12:35.720
how the rendering of it in our browser will keep changing.

170
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:44.860
Now, obviously, the rendering of the page in our browser is still terrible.

171
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.230
It's better than the typical computer science professors web page,

172
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.715
but definitely not readable.

173
00:12:51.715 --> 00:12:58.320
We need to now bring into action the various CSS classes and

174
00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.910
the JavaScript components that

175
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:06.960
our Bootstrap web UI framework provides in order to design our web page.

176
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:12.720
So we will do that step by step as we go through this exercise.

177
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:18.535
This may be a convenient time for you to do a git commit of

178
00:13:18.535 --> 00:13:24.355
the changes that you have made so that at the end of this exercise,

179
00:13:24.355 --> 00:13:30.365
your state of your project folder will be saved to your git repository.

180
00:13:30.365 --> 00:13:36.610
Going to my conFusion folder in another tab of my terminal window,

181
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.990
if I type git status,

182
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:44.455
I now see that my index.html file and the package of JSON file have been modified.

183
00:13:44.455 --> 00:13:47.930
So I'm going to do a commit.

184
00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:04.635
So, now, my status of

185
00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:10.610
the folder at the end of this exercise has been committed to my git repository.

186
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.920
You can synchronize that with your online repository so that

187
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.390
the state of your project will be saved at this point.

188
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:24.955
With this, we complete our first Bootstrap exercise.

189
00:14:24.955 --> 00:14:33.210
You have now seen how we can configure Bootstrap to be used in our web project.

190
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.140
As we proceed to the next few exercises,

191
00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:42.470
we're going to employee the Bootstrap classes to design our web pages.
