2
00:00:04.156 --> 00:00:08.210
Git is a very popular version
control system for software.

3
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.420
We need Git for working with our node

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.520
ecosystem that we're going to use
throughout this specialization.

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.380
So it is important for
you to get Git on to your computer.

6
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.820
So let's go through a few quick steps
to set up Git on your computer and

7
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.850
then some quick commands to enable us to
make use of Git in this specialization.

8
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.180
I will not go into too much details
about version control and how Git works,

9
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.200
and so on.

10
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.580
That is beyond the scope of this course.

11
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.770
Instead, we'll just get some
basic understanding of Git.

12
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.470
Git is, as I said,
a version control system.

13
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.370
This is a software tool
that enables us for

14
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.570
the management of changes to source code
and maintaining your version history.

15
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.460
So as your source code evolves,

16
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.610
you will be able to check in the code
at different points of times so

17
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.640
that you can always have a way of
rolling back to a previous version,

18
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.510
in case your updates to the code
doesn't work correctly.

19
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.350
There are various version control systems
that are in use in the real world,

20
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.220
including CVS, SVN, and

21
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.330
Git being a very popular mechanism for
version control these days.

22
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.860
Where did Git originate?

23
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.820
Git was designed by Linus Torvalds, the
person behind the Linux Operating System.

24
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.630
Git was designed as a version control
system and distributed version control

25
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.320
system for
use in Linux kernel development and

26
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.610
it has seen much wider deployment
in the real world, these days.

27
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.830
That node ecosystem is very
much tied into Git and

28
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.780
that is the reason why we need Git for
this specialization.

29
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.720
Let's now move on to
a Few hands on exercises,

30
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.220
where you will first set up Git.

31
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.330
Then you will learn a few
basic Git commands.

32
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.300
And then also understand how you
can set up an online repository

33
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.610
in places like Git Hub or Bit Bucket for

34
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.190
synchronizing your source code from
your computer to the online repository.

35
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.160
This is obviously not a comprehensive
tutorial on the Git but we'll learn just

36
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.439
enough, that of the commands that are
necessary for use in this specialization.

37
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.900
Let's now run through a few quick
steps to set up Git on your computer.

38
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.200
One easy way of setting
up Git on a computer

39
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.790
is to go to this site called git-sem.com.

40
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.010
And then download the Git
installation files from there.

41
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.060
So when you visit this website,
git.scm.com, you will see on

42
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.450
the right-hand side, here,
a button for you to download to Git.

43
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.330
If you want to you can go directly to
the Downloads page here on the site,

44
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.110
and then you will find the downloads for
various platforms and

45
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.790
you can download the one for
your specific platform for installation.

46
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.300
This is the easiest way of
getting Git onto your computer.

47
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.700
There are other ways of setting up Git,
depending on your platform.

48
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.220
For example, if you install
GitHub Desktop on your computer,

49
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.450
it'll automatically set up Git for you.

50
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.710
If you are using a Mac and
you set up x code and

51
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.340
especially the x code command line tools,
that will also set up Git for you.

52
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.590
On this site, gitscm.com,
if you go to the documentation page you

53
00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.640
will notice that there is
a book here called Pro Git.

54
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.610
You can just go on to
the Getting Started link.

55
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.720
You will see a specific chapter
here on Installing git.

56
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.640
So just go to this Installing Git site and
there you have more details

57
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.450
about how to install Git
on your specific platform.

58
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.180
So you can use any of
the methods suggested here for

59
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.400
installing Git on your platform.

60
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.100
This is fairly straight forward so

61
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.850
I'm not going to go through
the details of how to do the set up.

62
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.400
Download the installer and run through
the set up to get Git on to your computer.

63
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.300
Once you install Git on a computer
Start up a command window or

64
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.910
PowerShell if you're
using a Window machine or

65
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.490
start up a terminal window
if you're using a Mac or

66
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.945
Linux machine and
then at the prompt type in git

67
00:04:54.945 --> 00:05:01.340
--version to check what version of
git is installed on your computer.

68
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.360
So on my machine I have this current
version of git installed and

69
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.880
that is good enough for me to work with.

70
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.190
Once we verify that Git is installed,
we will configure a couple of global

71
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.610
identity parameters,
the username and email address.

72
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.180
So that whenever Git does in
a comics as you will learn later,

73
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.410
it will make use of this information.

74
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:35.260
To do that, at the prompt type
git config --global user.name,

75
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.899
and then you can type in your user name.

76
00:05:44.847 --> 00:05:48.333
The other parameter that I'm
going to configure is my email.

77
00:06:00.676 --> 00:06:06.446
And to insure that this
information has been configured,

78
00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:09.280
we can type git config list.

79
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.440
And it will list out a bunch of
configurations that we have.

80
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.010
Done.

81
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.470
Some of these are automatically set up for
you.

82
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.010
But if you want to,
you can set them up as you require.

83
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.840
So here I have my core
editor value set to vi,

84
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.860
which is what I use to do
command line editing of files.

85
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:38.890
So, with this, we have completed
the setup git for use on our computer.

86
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.827
Once you get git on your computer it
is time to go and learn git bit by bit.

87
00:06:44.827 --> 00:06:48.369
