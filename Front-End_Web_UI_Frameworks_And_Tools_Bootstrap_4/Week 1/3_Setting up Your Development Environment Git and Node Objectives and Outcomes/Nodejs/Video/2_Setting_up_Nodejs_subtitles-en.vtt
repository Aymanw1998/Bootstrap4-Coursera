00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:11.405
So, are you all excited and rubbing your hands eagerly to get hold of Node.js?

2
00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:13.095
You don't need to wait for too long.

3
00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:18.905
Let's just head over to nodejs.org and get hold of Node.js.

4
00:00:18.905 --> 00:00:26.350
In your browser, head over to nodejs.org and as you browse down,

5
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.145
you'll see the download buttons for Node.js for your specific platform.

6
00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:35.960
In this case, it shows the download buttons for MacOS.

7
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.895
So, click on the current version of Node.js.

8
00:00:39.895 --> 00:00:46.020
Click on that to download the installer package for your platform.

9
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.455
Once you get hold of the installer package,

10
00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:56.250
double click on it to start installing Node.js.

11
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.090
Depending on your operating system,

12
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.670
you will see a window like this on your computer and just follow

13
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.230
along the instructions to install Node.js on your machine.

14
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.660
You may need administrative privileges to install Node.js on your machine.

15
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.540
So make sure that you are logged in into an administrator account and

16
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.465
install Node.js to be accessible by all users that are logged in on the computer.

17
00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:26.930
And once the installation is complete,

18
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.385
let's go ahead and verify that Node.js has been installed correctly.

19
00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:37.380
Open up a terminal window or a command window and add the prompt,

20
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.365
type node-v to check the version of node installed.

21
00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:51.880
Similarly, check npm-v to check the version of NPM installed.

22
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.130
I am starting with these versions of node and NPM,

23
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.970
and the subsequent exercises will be based on these.

24
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.315
Even if you install the later version,

25
00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:05.775
I'm pretty sure that it would be backward compatible.

26
00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:09.760
So all the steps should work pretty much the same.

27
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.140
With this, we complete the installation of Node.js.

28
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.950
So let's go ahead and make use of Node.js in the next exercise.
