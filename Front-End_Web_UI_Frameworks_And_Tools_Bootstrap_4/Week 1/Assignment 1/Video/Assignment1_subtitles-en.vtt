00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.465
It is time for your first assignment in this course.

2
00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:10.975
In the first assignment,

3
00:00:10.975 --> 00:00:18.605
we're going to provide you with unstyled aboutus.html page.

4
00:00:18.605 --> 00:00:22.130
The zip file containing that aboutus.html

5
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.670
page is available to you in the assignment instructions.

6
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.530
So you need to download the page and then move that page to your con Fusion folder.

7
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.060
Thereafter, you will apply

8
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.970
Bootstrap classes and the Bootstrap Flexbox grid to style the page,

9
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.780
then you move the page to the Con Fusion folder,

10
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.095
then you can view the page in your browser by typing

11
00:00:52.095 --> 00:01:01.810
localhost:3000/aboutus.html and your light server build server up the aboutus.html page,

12
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.310
so this is the only way you can get to view the page.

13
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.545
So to begin with,

14
00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:08.775
the page will look like this,

15
00:01:08.775 --> 00:01:12.520
a completely Unstyle page which just contains content.

16
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:20.165
Now your job is to go through three tasks in order to format this page.

17
00:01:20.165 --> 00:01:23.245
Let's look at the three tasks in more detail.

18
00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:26.890
Your first task is to apply

19
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.850
the Bootstraps CSS and the Javascript classes to the aboutus.html

20
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:42.415
page so that this page will be instantly transformed into this page,

21
00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:48.470
where as soon as you add the Bootstraps CSS and JavaScript classes,

22
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.115
the header and footer will automatically get formatted correctly,

23
00:01:54.115 --> 00:01:59.170
because I have simply copied the header in the footer from the index.html page into

24
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.140
this page and I left all the Bootstrap formatting as such,

25
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.955
but the actual content of the page is still left unstyled.

26
00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:14.580
So now, as the second task,

27
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.580
you're going to apply the Bootstraps Flexbox grid including the Container,

28
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.190
the rows and the column classes to

29
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.430
this content or the page so that you can style it properly.

30
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.345
Now, when apply the classes,

31
00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:36.430
you're going to apply the row and column classes to the aboutus to just leave it as such.

32
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.390
Then you're going to apply the row and column classes to

33
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.445
this content so that this content occupies only half the screen,

34
00:02:45.445 --> 00:02:48.740
and then you're going to apply the row and column classes to

35
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.245
this content so that have occupies the entire screen width.

36
00:02:53.245 --> 00:03:00.300
So, choose the row and column classes correctly to apply to this.

37
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.220
You can use the custom CSS classes that we have already

38
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.510
implemented for the index.html by adding the style.css file,

39
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.765
also to style the content in this page.

40
00:03:14.765 --> 00:03:18.010
So when you complete the second task,

41
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.990
your page will end up being styled like this.

42
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.290
So you can see that the aboutus page exists in its own.

43
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.505
Then Our History part,

44
00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:37.800
notice that on a small to large screen size,

45
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.815
the Our History will occupy only half the screen width.

46
00:03:43.815 --> 00:03:51.850
Then the Corporate Leadership part occupies the entire screen width in this case.

47
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.000
This is the second task that you need to complete in your assignment.

48
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.660
For the third task as you can see,

49
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.380
this content layout looks fine for larger screen sizes,

50
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:13.240
but when you go to the extra small screen size especially like this,

51
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.415
you notice that the content is too much in this section.

52
00:04:20.415 --> 00:04:27.670
So what we would like to do is to use another Bootstrap class provided for us called,

53
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.615
[inaudible] and DSM block.

54
00:04:31.615 --> 00:04:37.865
There is a link to the responsive classes in the assignment resources,

55
00:04:37.865 --> 00:04:44.550
so you can check out the documentation for the [inaudible] and DSM block.

56
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.440
You need to apply those so that this description will be

57
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.400
hidden in the extra small screen sizes.

58
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.955
So when you the classes to this corporate leadership part,

59
00:04:59.955 --> 00:05:06.040
the same content will now be laid out without the description,

60
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.465
so it will be hidden in the extra small screens size.

61
00:05:10.465 --> 00:05:14.170
But when you go to the small the large screen size,

62
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.335
the content will become visible.

63
00:05:16.335 --> 00:05:21.200
So you can notice that for the extra small screen size,

64
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.760
the content is hidden,

65
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.170
but for the small screen size,

66
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.475
that description content will be shown clearly.

67
00:05:30.475 --> 00:05:35.310
So this is your third task in your assignment.

68
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.175
While you are at it, you can also apply the same classes to

69
00:05:40.175 --> 00:05:45.810
the descriptions in our index.html page so that

70
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.480
the detailed descriptions for the content items will also be hidden in

71
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.645
the index.html page when it is viewed on extra small screen sizes.

72
00:05:57.645 --> 00:06:02.090
This completes your first assignment.

73
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.965
Also, when you submit your assignment,

74
00:06:04.965 --> 00:06:14.460
please take a full page screen shot of your layout

75
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.615
both in small to

76
00:06:19.615 --> 00:06:25.930
extra large screen size and also on the extra small screen size,

77
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.230
and then include that as part of your submission.

78
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.420
To take a full page screenshot in Chrome,

79
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.000
you can use a Chrome extension that is available to us,

80
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.305
the link to the Chrome extension is provided in

81
00:06:39.305 --> 00:06:45.325
the assignment resources that follow the assignment description.

82
00:06:45.325 --> 00:06:48.555
After you complete your assignment,

83
00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:52.610
in case you're saving your changes to a Git Repository,

84
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.750
please don't forget to commit the changes to

85
00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.090
