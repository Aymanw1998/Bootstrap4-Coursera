1
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.660
We'll continue with the bootstrap grid exercise

2
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.074
that we started out in the previous exercise.

3
00:00:11.074 --> 00:00:14.535
We're going to do a few more things to our index.html

4
00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:18.965
page in order to improve its layout.

5
00:00:18.965 --> 00:00:24.085
We're going to use some custom CSS classes and add some color

6
00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:30.535
to our index.html page using custom CSS classes.

7
00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:39.265
The next thing that I'm going to do is go down to the footer and for this UL here,

8
00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:42.790
you'll notice that this list when you look at

9
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.705
our web page is displayed in the web page using this bulleted list here.

10
00:00:49.705 --> 00:00:52.820
I'm not too happy with this bulleted list,

11
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.350
I want to remove these bullet points and then simply show them as only the links there.

12
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.440
So to do that, I'm going to use another list style called as

13
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.120
list- unstyled and apply that to that UL tag there.

14
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.950
Going back to our web page,

15
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.425
to this UL tag in the footer,

16
00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:21.520
I'm going to apply the class as list-unstyled,

17
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:32.275
and this would remove those bullets in front of these links there.

18
00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:40.375
Now, let me add a few custom CSS classes to the index.html page.

19
00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:49.635
To do that, we will now create a folder here and name it as the CSS folder here.

20
00:01:49.635 --> 00:01:51.650
Inside the CSS folder,

21
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:59.670
I'm going to create a new file and name the file as styles.css.

22
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.835
Now, inside the styles.css file,

23
00:02:02.835 --> 00:02:11.685
I can now add some CSS classes in order to style our page.

24
00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:14.600
Let me add some CSS classes here.

25
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.765
So, I would add my first class as row header.

26
00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:21.035
So as the name implies,

27
00:02:21.035 --> 00:02:23.770
this class I am applying to the header.

28
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.865
And then, I would apply the margin as

29
00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:34.330
zero pixel auto and

30
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.150
then padding as zero pixel auto.

31
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.820
So, this is for the row header.

32
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.100
So, I'm going to have zero margin and zero padding for the row header.

33
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.840
And then for the row contents,

34
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.005
so I'm going to add one more CSS class called row-content.

35
00:02:54.005 --> 00:03:01.470
And then for this, I will add margin zero pixel auto,

36
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.815
and then padding have it at 50 pixel,

37
00:03:07.815 --> 00:03:16.170
zero pixel, 50 and zero pixel.

38
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.060
Then I'm going to add a border at

39
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.880
the bottom of my row here.

40
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.195
And then, the border I will give it one pixel and then call it a ridge.

41
00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:45.915
And I will set the minimum height to be 400 pixel for the content here.

42
00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:51.910
That way, my web page will look like more nicer on the screen.

43
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.475
Now this again, you have to try and

44
00:03:55.475 --> 00:03:59.900
see until you are satisfied with the way the page is laid out.

45
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.560
Now also, I'm going to include

46
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.320
one more class called as the footer which as you might have already guessed,

47
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.560
I'm going to apply to the footer and I

48
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:21.100
will apply a background color to the footer as D1C4E9.

49
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.465
If you ask me how I selected the color,

50
00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:37.630
I just looked up the color and then I was happy with that color.

51
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.460
You can choose any color you want to apply,

52
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.460
but this color seems to be good for me.

53
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.950
So, I added that color.

54
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.110
And for the padding, for the footer,

55
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:58.890
I would add 20 pixel and zero pixels.

56
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:06.160
Now, once I have added this styles to my CSS file,

57
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.610
let me apply the CSS file to the index.html page.

58
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.820
I'm going to index.html page.

59
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.950
Obviously, I need to use that CSS file inside my index.html page.

60
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.160
So right after the bootstrap CSS file,

61
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:32.200
I'm going to do a link and style sheet,

62
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.900
and this is style.css file there.

63
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.525
So that is where my CSS file is stored.

64
00:05:43.525 --> 00:05:49.760
So, I'm going to include that into my index.html page.

65
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.350
Now, I am going to go into the body and apply the classes that I have just created.

66
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.955
So going to the header,

67
00:05:57.955 --> 00:06:03.055
I will apply the row header class to the div in the header.

68
00:06:03.055 --> 00:06:07.475
Then, for the content,

69
00:06:07.475 --> 00:06:14.085
I would apply the row content classes to the rows there.

70
00:06:14.085 --> 00:06:21.180
So, to the three rows in the content,

71
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:26.690
I apply the row content class and then going down to the footer,

72
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.325
to the footer tag,

73
00:06:28.325 --> 00:06:32.315
I will apply the class footer here,

74
00:06:32.315 --> 00:06:35.240
and then save the changes.

75
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.290
Let's go and have a look at that page now.

76
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.430
Going to your web page,

77
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.970
we're already beginning to see some interesting changes to the web page.

78
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.960
So, you can now see that the content in

79
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.445
the web page has been laid out a bit more cleaner.

80
00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:58.290
That is the border bottom that we added to the row content,

81
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.200
so you can see that there is enough separation between the rows although

82
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.530
the contents of the rows are still positioned towards the top in the rows,

83
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.900
so you have these three rows and then look at the footer,

84
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.740
the footer now has acquired the background color that I applied,

85
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:26.717
and notice how the links are styled with the list-unstyled on the left side here.

86
00:07:26.717 --> 00:07:33.495
We are not done yet, we got to do a few more changes to the index.html page,

87
00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:39.320
and then come back and have a look at the final result of this exercise.

88
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.485
Going back to your Editor,

89
00:07:41.485 --> 00:07:46.955
I'm going to add a few more CSS classes into my style structure,

90
00:07:46.955 --> 00:07:53.290
it is a file, so I'm going to go in there and then add a class called Jumbotron.

91
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:59.265
So, you'll see that we have already applied the Jumbotron to our header there.

92
00:07:59.265 --> 00:08:03.145
Now, if I add more properties to this Jumbotron class here,

93
00:08:03.145 --> 00:08:05.875
this will be applied to the Jumbotron,

94
00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:11.535
in addition to the standard default Jumbotron that bootstrap already includes.

95
00:08:11.535 --> 00:08:13.835
I'm going to add in a few more things,

96
00:08:13.835 --> 00:08:17.355
I'm going to add in a padding of

97
00:08:17.735 --> 00:08:28.765
70 and 30 pixel on its surroundings,

98
00:08:29.095 --> 00:08:38.515
and then a margin of zero pixel all around,

99
00:08:38.515 --> 00:08:51.685
and I will set the background of this to 9575CD.

100
00:08:51.685 --> 00:09:01.065
This is somewhat of a darker purple color which seems to go very well on the Jumbotron.

101
00:09:01.065 --> 00:09:03.430
Again, by trial and error,

102
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.975
I selected that color,

103
00:09:04.975 --> 00:09:11.735
and also the text color as floral white.

104
00:09:13.205 --> 00:09:15.305
So for the Jumbotron,

105
00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:18.615
we are going to apply those classes, and also,

106
00:09:18.615 --> 00:09:24.765
I'm going to apply one more class to the address class.

107
00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:26.520
We have an address in the footer,

108
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:34.685
so I'm going to change the font size of that to 80 percent,

109
00:09:34.685 --> 00:09:38.935
a slightly smaller font than the normal font,

110
00:09:38.955 --> 00:09:43.455
and the margin, I will give it a zero pixel,

111
00:09:43.455 --> 00:09:50.285
and the color, I'm going to use zero F,

112
00:09:50.285 --> 00:09:52.350
zero F, zero F,

113
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.730
and then save the changes.

114
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.730
So couple more CSS classes added,

115
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.530
switching back to index.html.

116
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.475
What I'm going to do now,

117
00:10:03.475 --> 00:10:07.775
is to go to the content rows and then

118
00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:11.990
I'm going to try and position this content in the middle,

119
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.605
vertically in that row.

120
00:10:14.605 --> 00:10:17.930
This is where I'm going to take the help of

121
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:23.050
the vertical alignment that bootstrap grid supports through the Flexbox support.

122
00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:31.395
To do that, I would say align-items-center,

123
00:10:31.495 --> 00:10:38.620
so this is the other class that I need to add, align-items-center.

124
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:45.475
And I'm going to add that to the remaining two rows also,

125
00:10:45.475 --> 00:10:51.735
align-items-center to the second and the third row,

126
00:10:53.185 --> 00:11:01.965
and that should do a vertical justification of the content of the rows.

127
00:11:01.965 --> 00:11:03.880
We'll see the result in a minute.

128
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.230
Going down to the footer.

129
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.835
In the footer, you see that we have used

130
00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:13.825
the column auto for this copyright content there.

131
00:11:13.825 --> 00:11:18.265
Now, I'm going to position this right in the middle horizontally

132
00:11:18.265 --> 00:11:24.160
using that justify-content-center class,

133
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:32.755
so there is a justify content and a few other classes there.

134
00:11:32.755 --> 00:11:35.890
I'm going to use to justify-content-center class for that.

135
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:44.605
That will essentially position that column in the center of the row there.

136
00:11:44.725 --> 00:11:48.560
That applied to that, and then,

137
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.415
one little change that I'm going to do,

138
00:11:51.415 --> 00:11:53.370
is to this inner div there,

139
00:11:53.370 --> 00:12:01.665
I'm going to apply a class as text-center to that,

140
00:12:01.665 --> 00:12:06.435
so that these links are centered on the screen.

141
00:12:06.435 --> 00:12:11.340
With these changes, let's go and take a look at the web page,

142
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.135
at end of this exercise.

143
00:12:14.135 --> 00:12:16.120
Going to our web page,

144
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.020
our web page is already starting to look even better now,

145
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:25.885
so you can now see that the Jumbotron is now styled with a new background color,

146
00:12:25.885 --> 00:12:28.955
which is a little dark purple there,

147
00:12:28.955 --> 00:12:34.980
and the lettering is now in floral white color,

148
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.190
little bit indented there,

149
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:44.345
then you can now see that the content in the content rows are now vertically centered,

150
00:12:44.345 --> 00:12:47.500
for the three content rows.

151
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:54.645
This is the use of the align-items-center that we applied to the rows there.

152
00:12:54.645 --> 00:12:56.525
Then going to the footer,

153
00:12:56.525 --> 00:13:03.380
you can now see that this copyright is now justified to the center of the screen.

154
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:08.155
Look at how the links here have been centered.

155
00:13:08.155 --> 00:13:15.985
I realized that I want to also position this vertically centering to this particular row,

156
00:13:15.985 --> 00:13:19.855
so let's go and apply one more class to move this to

157
00:13:19.855 --> 00:13:24.540
the center of this particular row vertically.

158
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.100
So to do that, going back to index.

159
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:34.115
html, in the footer for that particular column which contains those,

160
00:13:34.115 --> 00:13:41.795
I will apply the class as align-self-center.

161
00:13:41.795 --> 00:13:48.485
This should be applied to the div which uses the column class.

162
00:13:48.485 --> 00:13:54.185
With this, that particular content will be aligned to the center of the row.

163
00:13:54.185 --> 00:13:56.570
The remaining content will still remain at the top.

164
00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.575
Let's take a final look at the footer.

165
00:13:59.575 --> 00:14:01.705
Going to the footer in our web page,

166
00:14:01.705 --> 00:14:06.345
you can now see how this has been positioned vertically in the center.

167
00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:10.715
These two pieces of content are still aligned to the top of the row,

168
00:14:10.715 --> 00:14:15.215
that is fine because that looks okay on in there,

169
00:14:15.215 --> 00:14:21.340
but this one I have dragged it down vertically to the center of this particular row.

170
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:25.545
